        <h3>So what the F#(% is a Swankie Yankee</h3>
        <p>
          Well, a Swankie Yankee, a term commonly used in the Deep South of the
          United States of America, is a term used for a person who has moved
          directly or indirectly from their place of birth to Seattle Washington
          before ultimately moving to Detroit Michigan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although a Swankie Yankee is a person who lived in Seattle for no more
          than three years and no less than 18 months, the term is used by some
          for any person moving from Seattle to Detroit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it has been used erroneously, a Swankie Yankee can not be a
          person who moved to Detroit from Seattle indirectly: for example, a
          person who has lived in Seattle for 2 years before then moving to
          Cleveland Ohio for 1 year and then ultimately moving to Detroit can
          not be a Swankie Yankee because of their extended residency between
          living in Seattle and Detroit.
